                One of the most prominent competitions VICulP takes part in is <b>Firodia Karandak</b>—a unique intercollegiate
                showcase that blends theatre with multiple art forms. It’s not just a stage play, it feels like <b>a movie 
                brought to life</b>, with complex scenes executed live using <b>acting, music, dance, painting, and more.</b>

                Each performance is original and creatively intense, making every college stand out. Being part of VICulP
                and performing in Firodia Karandak every year has been an incredible journey—one that has pushed my artistic 
                limits.

            <h2><b>Artist Section In VICulP</b></h2>

            <p>
            <font size="5">
            During my time in <b>VICulP</b>, I was primarily a part of the<b>Artist Section</b>, which plays a vital role in adding 
            a powerful visual layer to our performances. As artists, we work live on stage, using mediums like <b>painting, sculpture,
            and other creative expressions</b> to bring out emotions that are often difficult to portray through acting alone.
            </font>
            </p>
            
            <p>
            <font size="5">
            For example, portraying something as delicate as nostalgia through acting can be challenging. But when visualized through 
            art—like a symbolic painting or a powerful sculpture—it becomes more relatable and emotionally impactful for the audience. 
            While it may appear effortless on stage, this kind of artistic storytelling demands intense practice, coordination, and 
            creativity.

            Now let me take you through my journey with VICulP, year by year—a reflection of the growth, experiences, and unforgettable 
            moments that shaped my time in the club.
