                Hey Buddyyyy, Let's see some <b>Memorable Moments</b> of the Academic year 2023-24.

                This year, I was determined <b>not to miss the chance to perform on stage</b>. I began <b>intensive practice 
                in mid-December</b>, focusing mainly on improving speed and mastering the <b>acrylic medium</b>.

            <font size="5">
                Alongside acrylics, I <b>experimented with palette knife painting</b>. While the textures were stunning, the 
                medium consumed a lot of paint and dried too quickly for live performance.

                Our story that year centered around a <b>farmer’s life</b>, and I felt a strong urge to connect with the theme in a
                deeper, more organic way. Having previously worked with soil, I decided to create <b>soil painting</b> to reflect 
                the farmer’s emotions.

                        this piece captured the farmer’s breaking point 
                        and his suicidal thoughts..

                        Since it was selected for the final act, I practiced 
                        it rigorously—painting it more than 20 times to reduce 
                        the completion time to exactly 7 minutes. It became so 
                        ingrained in me that I felt I could paint it even if 
                        woken up from sleep.

            On <b>16th February 2024</b>, we performed our play <b>"Paulkhuna"</b>.
            After months of hard work and preparation, stepping onto the stage felt surreal. 
            surreal.The performance was powerful, emotional, and truly unforgettable—a 
            moment where all our efforts came to life.
